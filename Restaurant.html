        <h3>pizza</h3>
        <p>
          PIZZA is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat
          base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and
          often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions,
          olives, vegetables, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high
          temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

        <h3>pasta</h3>
        <p>
            PASTA is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking.<br>
            Unlike noodles, pasta was traditionally only made with durum, although the definition has been expanded to include alternatives for a gluten-free diet such as rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils.<br>
             While noodles are believed to have originated in Asia, pasta is believed to have originated in Italy and is a staple food of Italian cuisine.
